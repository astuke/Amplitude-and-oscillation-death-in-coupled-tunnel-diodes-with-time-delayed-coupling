# Circuit_of_tunnel_diodes

These matlab codes simulate the dynamics of electric circuits consisting of tunnel diodes combined with reactive circuit components (resistancs and capacitances), forming electronic oscillators which converts direct current from a power supply to an alternating current signal. Each tunnel diode is modeled by an N-shaped current-voltage characteristic with a region of negative differential conductance. The tunnel diodes are arranged in different configurations:

- a single tunnel diode in an eletrical circuit
- two tunnel diodes coupled in series (with and without a time-delayed coupling)
- two tunnel diodes coupled in parallel (with an without a time-delayed coupling)

In the series and parallel circuits, two principally different dynamics were found, depending on the value of the input voltage: For low and high input voltage, the tunnel diodes respond with a constant current signal, but behave differently from each other, forming so called multistable current branches as in semiconductor superlattices. For medium input voltage, the tunnel diodes are synchronized and respond with oscillating current signals, forming so called excitation blocks similar to neural networks.
